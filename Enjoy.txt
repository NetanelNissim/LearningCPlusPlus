----------
1) Function is called GetFileName(), but actually it does something different
2) Implement an object in separate CPP (FileReader) that does ALL file handling (open, close, data holder, ...)
3) Implement an exception class in separate CPP, which inherits from std::exception and does all FileReader error handling
